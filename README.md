# California_Covid_update_shiny_app

### Authors: Thien D Nguyen, Ezi Tsogli, Jimmie Davies

Created as a result of the need for the state of California to see trends and implement ways to slow the effects of the COVID 19 pandemic in the state. I used R techniques learned in Visual Analytics course in the Data Science and Business Analytics master's program at the University of North Carolina Charlotte. This app is created based on the data set that is provided by the Govermonent of California. This data set is about the Covid situation in California in the period of time from 03/2020 to 03/2021. This data set contains multiple tables about the total cases, age groups and races get hit by Covid, testing availability, ICU bed availability,... As California reopens, Californians must follow best practices and make informed decisions to save lives in the state. By understanding trends and geographic spread of COVID-19 displayed through the graphs on our app, local goverment can take action to protect their citizens and each citizen can also know what they need to do to protect themselves and their loved ones!
